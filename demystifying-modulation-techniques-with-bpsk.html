        <div><p>The multitude of Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs) 
introduced in IEEE802.11 for the VHT and HE PHYs may look like magical 
spells even for the seasoned wireless engineer. At the start of my journey 
as a telecommunications engineer, I was particularly
fascinated by the mathematics behind how to carry information from a transmitter
(TX) to a receiver (RX). I believe it might be worth it to take a step back
and get a mathematical intuition of what is happening behind the scenes when 
a STA interacts with the wireless medium.</p>
<p>Assuming we can transmit the signal wave <em>s(t)</em>, as in the equation below, where
A is the amplitude, f is the signal frequency, and the time, we could consider
representing 1's as <em>s(t)</em> and 0's as <em>-s(t)</em>. </p>
<!-- s(t) = A*cos(2*pi*f*t) -->

<p><center>
    <img alt="Simple cosine signal" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/cosine_base_signal.png">
</center></p>
<p>The receiver station would immediately recognise what value we are transmitting 
by comparing what is received with the reference signal,
which is assumed to be known. 
The figure below shows the comparison between the reference signal and what can 
be seen at the receiving station, considering path loss exclusively and ignoring
additional effects such as multipath; the picture shows a one being received,
followed by a zero.</p>
<p><center>
    <img alt="periodic" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/bpsk_periodic_zero_received_vs_reference.png">
</center></p>
<p>The carrier signal s(t) is not enough to transmit any meaningful
information in real life: the time variable t is an infinite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number">real number</a> and s(t) repeats
periodically with no start or end in time. We are busy people and we want
to transmit more than one bit in perpetuity, so we can define a new rectangular
function <em>p(t)</em> which is not-null only for <em>0 &lt;= t &lt;= T</em>, where <em>T = 1/f</em> is the
"period" of the signal s(t). </p>
<!-- 
p(t) =\begin{cases}
      1~if~0 \leq t \leq T\\
      0~otherwise
\end{cases}
-->
<!-- https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php -->
<p><center>
    <img alt="rectangular function" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/rect_function.png">
</center></p>
<p>Multiplying the two functions <em>g(t) = s(t)p(t)</em>, we get a limited section of the
original signal, namely a cycle of the cosine wave.</p>
<p><center>
    <img alt="Windowed cosine" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/windowed_signal.png">
</center></p>
<p>This signal p(t) is extremely powerful because it lets us move its "windowing" 
effect by simply shifting its "up" value by the period T to the left or right
over the time axis so that p(t-kT) = 1 for kT &lt;= t &lt;= (k+1)T, where k is any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integer number</a>. We can shift the
pulse <em>g(t)</em> by <em>kT</em> as well.</p>
<p>The windowed signals can be juxtaposed to represent a sequence of 0's and 1's
fairly easily as the entire signal can be described mathematically as a
summation <em>S(t)</em>, where N is the number of windows and the coefficient
<em>c</em> is 1 when transmitting a "one" bit, -1 otherwise.</p>
<!-- 
S(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k*g(t-kT) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_k*s(t-kT)*p(t-kT)
-->
<p><center>
    <img alt="pulse train formula" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/pulse_train_formula.png">
</center></p>
<p>The following image shows an example of the application of the above formula
when transmitting a zero followed by a one; the receiver can compare its
local reference to the received signal. Note that this example
considers the existence of some attenuation at RX due to Free Space Path Loss
while ignoring other detrimental effects such as multi-path.</p>
<p><center>
    <img alt="pulse train plot" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/bpsk_received_vs_reference.png">
</center></p>
<p>You might have noticed that some level of time synchronisation is
needed between the reference and the received signal to allow effective
demodulation. This fact is true regardless of the modulation technique in use,
and it intuitively justifies the existence of preamble sequences in the 
IEEE802.11 PHY Protocol Data Units (PPDUs).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we managed to transmit a sequence of single bits leveraging the 
simple fact that our RX can discriminate between a positive 
or a negative coefficient for the signal. 
We defined a signal constellation containing two pints which are shifted
180 degrees between each other: this technique is commonly referred to as
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) because the same base carrier <em>s(t)</em> can 
assume two different phase configurations to represent a single bit.</p>
<p><center>
    <img alt="pulse train plot" src="https://castogio.github.io/images/bpsk_constellation.png">
</center></p>
<p>Intuitively, we can expand the number of transmitted bits by following the same
principles of "tweak a parameter and compare to a reference" as described above.
We will explore Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
(QPSK), and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in future blog posts.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
