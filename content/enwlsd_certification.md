I have been swamped over the last month.
I spent a fantastic holiday in Italy with my loved ones, visiting Rome by night, exploring [Villa D'Este](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_d%27Este) in Tivoli
and overeating [Abruzzese food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Abruzzo). 
Follows a nice shot I took at the [Tremiti Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isole_Tremiti) in Apulia for my future self to remember what is important:

I had the chance to connect to the 2m radio repeater near my parent's house for the first time after getting my full ham license and talk to quite a few folks in Abruzzo.

I also dedicated time to professional development as I felt times were mature to sit an exam I failed in 2020. I passed Designing Cisco Enterprise Networks ([ENWLSD, 300-420](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/training/training-services/courses/designing-cisco-enterprise-networks-ensld.html)) last Friday. I felt great when I passed, as it was a good challenge.
I also signed up for the [Wireless LAN Professionals Conference in Prague](https://www.thewlpc.com/conferences/prague-czech-republic-2023) in October this year; I can't wait to meet people there.

In conclusion, here is a picture of my grandmother's dogs, Dido (_left_) and Giorgino (_right_):
