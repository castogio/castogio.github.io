My name is Gioacchino Castorio. but people call me Jack or Kino.
By day I troubleshoot dot11 wireless network, by night I like to call myself
MI0YTF as an amateur radio operator.

I spend most of my time working out, going for walks, reading technical books, 
or writing my own video games and utility programs in Python.

I created this blog to share tips and tricks when troubleshooting, avoiding some
common pitfalls, while heavily relying on network programmability and automation 
which have greatly simplified my day-to-day.
