I spent a fantastic holiday in Italy with my loved ones, visiting Rome by night, exploring &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_d%27Este"&gt;Villa D'Este&lt;/a&gt; in Tivoli
and overeating &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Abruzzo"&gt;Abruzzese food&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to connect to the 2m radio repeater near my parent's house for the first time after getting my full ham license and talk to quite a few folks in Abruzzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also dedicated time to professional development as I felt times were mature to sit an exam I failed in 2020. I passed Designing Cisco Enterprise Networks (&lt;a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/training/training-services/courses/designing-cisco-enterprise-networks-ensld.html"&gt;ENWLSD, 300-420&lt;/a&gt;) last Friday. I felt great when I passed, as it was a good challenge.
I also signed up for the &lt;a href="https://www.thewlpc.com/conferences/prague-czech-republic-2023"&gt;Wireless LAN Professionals Conference in Prague&lt;/a&gt; in October this year; I can't wait to meet people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, here is a picture of my grandmother's dogs, Dido (&lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt;) and Giorgino (&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
